Hexagon
=======
Simple immitation of Super Hexagon

About
-----
This is a quick and simple game I threw together based off of Super Hexagon.
It was done as an experiment in games programming using the MVC architecture.
I also tried to apply some functional style to the code, inspired by Carmack's
blog on the subject. It was fun to write, and it's fun to poke at.

Known Issues
------------
 * No music - Funnily enough you can generate the start of one of SuperHexagon's
songs with a few lines of C. If I could remember the snippet I'd just use that
and loop it, until then the game is silent.
 * No sound effects - Some nice sound effects would really lend themselves
towards the experience
 * No high scores - Obviously this should be subject to always-online DRM with
lots of safeguards that hassle the player(!)
 * No menu or settings - A way to choose various difficulties and change
settings would really bring this up to the level of Super Hexagon.
